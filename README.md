Notes and good info from books I've read are stored here for reference and sharing. Most are related to web development, although some are from more general non-fiction that I find useful.

Each is in markdown with some basic info on the book followed by an outline of all the important info. I update this repo even while many notes are still outlines or I'm still reading the material, so some will be unfinished.
