## 1) Write Code that Looks Like Ruby

* Ruby code is clear and self-explanatory. Aim for concise, obvious code that doesn't need lots of comments to understand.
    * For included comments, try for only ones explaining especially complex code or broad explanations of how to use the code. 
* Only spaces, no tabs. Indents are two spaces.
* Use **CamelCase** for class names, and **snake_case** for everything else.
