* Title: [It's (Not) You - 27 (Wrong) Reasons Why You're Single](https://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-You-Reasons-Single/dp/0399162879/)
* Author: Sara Eckel

## You Have Issues

*  If everyone had to “get right with themselves” before finding a partner, the population would have died off long ago.
*  The key to a happy marriage isn't having a ‘normal' personality but finding someone with whom you mesh.
*  What if your only “issue” is the belief that you have (issues) and that they're keeping you from a relationship?
*  ...the only reason you're alone is you just haven't met your partner yet?

## You Have Low Self-Esteem

* Research shows that people with high self-esteem are no more well-liked than those with low self-esteem—they only think they are more admired.
* Although we think being critical of ourselves will spur us into action, actually, the opposite is true.
* The bigger problem with self-esteem is that it's contingent on success.
* Instead, they tell themselves things like, “Everybody goofs up now and then,” or, “In the grand scheme of things, this really doesn't matter.”
These are people with self-compassion. They don't try to convince themselves and others of their greatness; they simply focus on treating themselves kindly.
* Neff advises talking to yourself as you would a good friend: “I'm so sorry you're in a bad place today, but these feelings you're having sound pretty normal to me. So why don't you ease up on yourself? We all feel weak or insecure sometimes. You're not alone.”
* Instead of assigning blame, you simply take a moment and acknowledge the painful disappointment you're feeling. You don't try to talk yourself out of feeling bad—since feeling bad is a completely natural response to rejection.

## You're Too Negative

* The really good dates were the ones where we shed the positivity facade fairly quickly. The ones where we talked about divorce and stepfamilies and melting ice caps. The ones where we forgot to censor ourselves, forgot to sell ourselves and just were ourselves—two somewhat lonely human beings trying to figure it all out.
* The “be positive” advice makes you fear the dark. You've got all the lights turned on, constantly vigilant.
* Clearly see unfortunate circumstances or unpleasant emotions for what they are—part of life, nothing to freak out about.

## You're Too Liberated

* Sociologist Christine Whelan found that women aged thirty to forty-four earning more than one hundred thousand dollars per year are—once again—more likely to be married than their lower-earning cohorts.
* Economist Dana Rotz, a researcher at Mathematica Policy Research, found that for every year a woman waits to marry, she lowers her risk of divorce.
* For a long time, having an education did correlate poorly with a woman's chance of marrying. “It truly used to be good advice for a woman to ‘play dumb' to catch a man. Not anymore.
* We have, apparently, left many people with the impression that we're mapping our personal lives with the same precision that we plot our careers—that we're “putting off” marriage, as if falling in love was something you could plan.
* You don't break up with someone you love because “work is crazy.” When you're in love, you steal whatever precious moments you can.
* Feminism never promised women that life would be easy—that there wouldn't be hard choices and massive trade-offs.
* Having agency in your life doesn't inhibit your ability to merge it with another's—it only enhances it.

## You're Too Intimidating

* The underlying message is the social gains women have made in the last few decades cause women to fail in love. They—and here's the real bummer—make women fundamentally unlovable,”
* “You may think that playing helpless will give you a romantic edge. But actually, all it does is to weed out the egalitarian men,” she wrote.
* This theory assumes, however, that all women with thriving careers have ultra-macho work personalities—that they've gotten ahead by being hard, mean, or aggressive.
* If your career is flourishing, wouldn't that actually speak well for your interpersonal skills?

## You're Too Desperate

* The fact that you want love is taken as evidence that you're not ready for it.
* Freedom is arguably our country's most sacrosanct value—unless we're talking about women's liberation. Then suddenly we become cold rationalists, debating pros and cons like a Soviet-era dictator.
* Why did I feel like my deep longing for romantic love made me a nitwit, as opposed to a human being feeling one of life's most natural desires?
* If you're single and feel a void—if you find that career, friends, books, and travel are actually not enough—it's not because you're dizzy-brained or immature; it's because you're feeling a very legitimate need.
* Sometimes loneliness, depression, frustration get the better of us. Sometimes that brutal rejection cannot be shaken off with a Pilates class or an ice cream cone. Sometimes we feel very intense pain. What I gradually learned was—that's okay.
* Desperate is having child after child because your husband won't let you use birth control or covering the bruises you got last night when you hurry to the market to shop for the evening meal. Women today may be anxious about finding a mate, but most could not even imagine being that desperate.

## You Need to Be Happy Alone

* Loneliness is akin to hunger or thirst—it's a natural human response that simply indicates that one needs nourishment.
* not a sign that you're deficient—they're a sign that you have a functioning internal alarm system.
* You can live in your one-bedroom and move up in your job and visit your nieces and have a long and productive life. But your biological wiring doesn't know that, which is why loneliness can bring on so much psychic pain.
* I'd like to suggest that you not label that as pain but simply allow yourself to feel it without judgment. The problem wasn't the pain. It was the thoughts around the pain.
* Feeling lonely made me feel like a loser, a failure, an outcast. By adding those feelings of shame, I doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled my pain.

## You're Too Picky

* “I want to find a guy who delights and surprises me as much as my friends do, but I also want to make out with.”
* The problem is that there's no chemistry, but your friends hear only about the fork-drumming—hence, you're too picky.
*  Stop talking about it. If I suspected that a friend's response to a failed five-day romance would annoy me I . . . didn't tell her.
*  You don't have to justify why you didn't go on that third Internet date if no one knows about the first one.
*  Human beings are not houses—you don't walk in and say, “Well, so long as we gut the kitchen and add a third bathroom, this could work,” or, “It has no charm, but it's close to work and it's all I can afford.” No. You love them as they are, or you let them find someone else who does.

## You're Too Available

* As with so much bad advice, there's a kernel of wisdom in there: Don't let another person determine your worth.
* the underlying message is: You must hide your true feelings and play-act at being someone else, because if they see who you really are and know how you really feel, they will leave.
* Puffing yourself up, making another person feel insecure, withholding kindness—this is not the way truly confident people behave.
* “The people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they are worthy of love and belonging. That's it.”
* They fully embraced vulnerability. They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful. They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable nor did they really talk about it being excruciating. . . . They just talked about it being necessary
* Love is risky. It involves emotions we can't control. It makes us feel wild, uncontained. This is a good thing, but it's also scary.
* showering your spouse with love and affection is far more likely to yield a lasting marriage than being aloof or withholding.
* Can you prolong a relationship with an ambivalent dipshit by withdrawing your affection? Very possibly. But why would you want to?

## You Don't Know How to Play the Game

* Marriage, we're told, is a “market.” Which I guess makes us all “commodities.”
* Lost in all this defensive dating is the fact that what's ultimately being sought is a loving partnership—by both parties.
* remember: That creep who screwed you over isn't most guys. 
* isn't it stronger and braver to go into relationships—and first dates—knowing full well you could get hurt, and that you'll also survive?

## You Need to Grow Up

* most single women's lifestyles are pretty far from their glitzy stereotype.
* Being single can be a blast, and it can be a grind. It can be extremely liberating to not have to consult another if you want to, say, move to California or join the Peace Corps. But it can also be very stressful to negotiate a home sale or navigate a foreign country without a partner.
* why a girl must be picky. Being married to the wrong person is work. Being married to an asshole is work
* all those years alone forced me to develop muscles that I never would have fired if I'd married at twenty-six

## You're Too Selfish

* Single people devote more time to their extended family, friends, and communities than their married cohorts.
* single people are simply out in the world more—spending more time than married couples at restaurants, bars, shops, and public events. They're also more likely to take art or music classes
* Single people aren't on the fringe of society—they are society.

## You Need to Put It Out to the Universe!

* if you've dragged out the crystals and started exploring your chakras for the express purpose of finding your soul mate, then it's going to be rough if that person doesn't materialize. Now you're not just alone, you're also out of sync with the universe. And that's sort of heavy.
* The least magical, most un-precious way of meeting people is also one of the most effective.
* It's wonderful to live in a home with harmoniously arranged furniture and who doesn't like a good soak in a rosemary-water tub? But laying on the extra thing—I'm doing this so I can find a partner—will only diminish these pleasures.
* Internet dating, like vaccines and eyeglasses, is one more thing that shows us we're not slaves to what “happens naturally.”

## You Need an Action Plan!

* Actively searching can be soul crushing, but as we all know “letting love come naturally”—let it find you at Pilates class or your marketing job—has serious problems too.
* How do you find, as the yoga teachers say, the balance between effort and surrender?
* The Buddhist view is that the cause of suffering is craving and ignorance. You're looking outside of yourself for happiness. You're not okay with the present reality.
* The problem is not in the wanting; the problem is what happens when you don't get what you want.
* Am I allowing my desire for the evening to go one way to spill into desperation or am I maintaining my dignity?
* Dignity is what happens when you don't get sucked into knee-jerk reactions.
* It's not suppressing or denying pain; it's allowing it to be there without embarrassment. Dignity transcends circumstance.
* The problem was we weren't having any fun. We were trying to force the evening to go one way, and we were caught up in a lot of storylines about why it wasn't.

## You're Too Fabulous to Settle Down

* The only way to really prove I didn’t need a guy was to have a guy—and then make clear how unnecessary he was.
* The fact that these men were strangers plucked from the ether—as opposed to friends of friends—meant that everyone understood that sex was a long ways off.
* the real message is one of panic: You must be special. Ordinary is not okay. When I walked into a party projecting the Shiny Girl—she of the lighthearted flings and glitzy job—I was essentially doing the same thing.
* I was allowing myself to fade into the background a bit, which strangely enough left me feeling stronger and more confident than when I was giving them the ole razzle-dazzle.
* We can’t all be fabulous and we can’t all be mothers, but we can all have meaningful lives. That will look different to everyone

## You're Too Sad

* Imagine asking a married person if she were happy. It would be wildly inappropriate.
* research “proving” that married people are happier than singles accounts only for the currently married, neglecting the roughly 40 percent of people who divorce.
* why is happiness the only marker of success? Why are there never debates and cover stories about who is more compassionate? Who is wiser? Who is more fun to have a beer with?
* To try and stamp out one feeling and replace it with another is to deny yourself life.
* longing was not desperation and loneliness was not failure.
* If you feel sad sometimes, it’s not because you’re single—it’s because you’re alive.

## You Are the Constant

*  the need to create that personal myth is seductive. Because with the story, you might get an explanation.
*  when I stepped back and looked at my own tall tales, the ratio of fanciful assumptions to sober facts was pretty high.
*  You don’t need to do anything different; you don’t need to be anything different. You just need a little luck.
*  You’re the only one who knows your experience. As imperfect as our analyses may be—as clouded as they are by judgments, worries, and fantasies—they’re still the best we have.

## You Have to Keep Trying!

* I needed a way to rest into my single life, without giving up on romantic love.
* Meditation had enabled me to short-circuit my thought tirades and do something more productive, like read ads for chemical peels in Spanish.
* Fulfilling career
Giving back
Adventurous
Financially stable
Good friend
Emotionally balanced
Physically fit
Somehow, I believed that by hitting all of these marks, I would one day emerge as a woman capable of a lifelong partnership. 
* I felt like I was studying extremely hard for an exam, only to see others ace it without cracking a book. And unfortunately, I allowed this goal-oriented view to siphon the very real happiness I was finding.
* This isn’t about giving up. It’s about lightening up.
* You’re already worthy. There’s nothing to prove.

## You're Stuck

* somewhere in the back of my brain, the question of my singleness was always grinding away, slowing sapping precious mental energy.
* But the “you’re stuck” advice has a false assumption—that the spinning and churning is the cause of the problem, rather than a symptom.
* It also assumes that those who have found their life partners are no longer burdened by useless, self-defeating thoughts. I can assure you that this is not the case.
* “If a person goes over and over something in their head, and then you say, ‘Write down your deepest darkest thoughts and go over it again,’ we will intensify their distress,
* I quickly noticed that the vast majority of my mind’s activity is either completely mundane (“What’s for lunch?”) or stuff I’d already thought before—many times. As Buddhist teacher Ethan Nichtern describes it, “I’m talking to myself, but I already know what I’m going to say.”
* psychic entropy. “The mind has a natural tendency to veer toward whatever is bothering us most,”
* analogy to scratching poison ivy. “It temporarily soothes the itch, but it also makes the poison spread,” she said.
* The essential practice is both extremely simple and extraordinarily difficult. You sit on a cushion for minutes, hours, or even days and try to keep your mind completely in the present
* The daily practice of calling myself on these micro-tirades means I’m quicker to catch myself when my mind gets hijacked by the stickier stuff
* It won’t stop the junk thoughts from coming, but with practice I’ve found it significantly loosens their grip.

## You Should Have Married That Guy

* there’s too much childhood hunger and wildlife-habitat destruction for any reasonable person to believe we all get what we deserve.
* You made those decisions based on your own unique abilities and preferences—it was just her good fortune that her desires and talents matched nicely with a well-paying career. Or, if she chose her profession for purely practical reasons—if she actually hates software programing—then it’s her karma to spend forty hours a week doing something she doesn’t like.
* there’s no need to make it into a reward/punishment thing—it’s just plain logic.
* How do you know if you’re settling? Easy. You’re settling if you think you’re settling.
Settling isn’t mature—it’s cruel. We all deserve to be loved and desired for who we are, for our essence—not our bank account, not our parenting skills, not because we happened to amble into someone’s life at the biologically optimal time. When you settle for a man, you’re preventing him from finding the woman who will love him for who he truly is. And that’s bad karma.

## You Don't Really Want a Relationship

* single people have become part of a more ominous narrative—the “decline of marriage.”
* I would argue that picky, career-focused singles are one of its greatest allies.
* flag-waving words like “duty,” “sacrifice,” and “institution.” The result is they make marriage sound less like a joyous union of two people and more like a deployment in Afghanistan.
* that’s what happens when you hold out for the right thing. You don’t feel superior—you just feel damn lucky.
* Maybe you’ve remained single well into adulthood because . . . you know what you’re doing. Because there is something right with you. The culture may portray older singles as losers and narcissists, but the truth is the person who ends the mediocre relationship before marriage—or who never starts it in the first place—is a true pillar of the institution.
* Perhaps what others call stubbornness or arrogance is actually good sense and intuition

## You Need Practice

* If you’re a smart, sensitive person, you’re going to learn and grow—no matter what you do.
* There are also many useful relationship skills that living on your own develops.
* The wisdom I gained as a single woman did absolutely nothing to help me find a husband—that was pure, blind chance—but it did make life easier, then and now.

## You're Too Old

* unfortunately, has left many single people with a brutal choice: Hold out for the right relationship or have biological kids.
* I hear heartbreak and wistfulness sometimes, but I don’t hear regret. The choice was tough, but it was ours.
* That’s the thing about hitting those big, bad birthdays—they happen and you realize that actually you have not suddenly morphed into a tragic Victorian spinster. You’re still you.

## You Don't Know Love

* Little credit is given to the person who has the sensitivity and intelligence to avoid the near-engagement or divorce—who takes months, rather than years, to realize the partnership isn’t working. No due is given the person who refuses to be jerked around—thus compelling the jerks to move on to easier prey. It’s assumed there is some love gene that you lack.
* it’s the feeling of connection you have whenever eyes meet, smiles are returned, or jokes are shared.
* With loving-kindness meditation, you wish happiness to others through a short mantra—the one I use is “May you be happy. May you be at peace. May you be free from suffering.” If genuine feelings follow, great. If not, that’s fine too.

## You Suck

* the impulse to evangelize for your own life choices is apparently one most of us are afflicted with.
* foisting your insecurities on someone else doesn’t diminish your pain—it only adds more pain to the world
* It’s not your job to convince them that you’re happy or a legitimate adult. It’s also not your job to determine whether another’s perceived self-satisfaction is born of genuine contentment or insecurity. Your job is to take care of yourself so you can meet others where they are.
* end the lifestyle arms race.
* The accusations that sting are the ones we partly buy—or simply make up ourselves.
* “When your demons come, offer them a piece of cake.”
* “It’s true that I get anxious at parties and hate my thighs, but I don’t think that makes me unlovable.”
* self-compassion is not just about buying yourself an ice cream cone—it’s about accepting the fact that you’re an ordinary person with flaws.
* they’re not invested in being better than anyone else.
* The demons feed on resistance, so when you aren’t afraid of them—when you can simply see them objectively and name them—they have nothing to work with. And when that happens, I’ve noticed that they very slowly leave.

## You Need to Figure Out “Why”

* there’s an understanding that inquiring about the reason two people marry is completely inappropriate. Singles are not afforded this privacy.
* The implication is that you need to explain yourself. Best answer is "I don't know."
* I was claiming the married person’s privilege—the right to have your life choices be no one’s business but your own.
* The real question is, why are near strangers so often compelled to demand answers?

## You'll Spend the Rest of Your Life Alone!

* She’s still hoping to meet that special person, but she no longer views her life as a waiting period for that day.
* grounds you in the reality that life is much less solid than we usually believe.
* Marriage can create an illusion of permanence.
* Enjoying things as they are but also working toward change isn’t living a second-class life; it’s living a full life—one where you clearly see what Tibetan Buddhists call “the truth of impermanence.”
