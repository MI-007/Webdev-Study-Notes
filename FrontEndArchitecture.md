# The Four Pillars of Front-end Architecture

### Code
* Modular - easy to pick up and drop elsewhere, project to project
    * Don't apply any width, float, outside padding, or outside margins to the element
    * Never rely on external elements or variables for key styles
    * Each element uses unique, scoped classes
    * Never use layouts to apply padding or other styles to smaller elements
    * Use the **BEM** naming convention
* Bind JS to data-* attributes, never classes. Better separation of concerns
* Use semantic HTML wherever possible!


### Testing
* Unit testing for Javascript


### Process


### Documentation
* Always supply a README for dealing with:
    * Workflow setup, requirements, and commands.
    * The project's who, what, where, when, why, how
    * **How to use** the code
* Five lines of code = one line of comments to explain it
    * For JS and CSS code
    * Keep comments clean, focused, and explain what and where the code works
